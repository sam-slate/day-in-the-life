Take the bus
**E2O1-Description**
Sounds good! The buses are notoriously sparse and late, so let's take 5 spoons away just for  scheduling and planning it. It also costs a bit of money.

Take an uber
**E2O2-Description**
You don't have to feel pain but it costs you money. Also, you feel super guilty about the unethical policies of the company but it's the only way you as a disabled person can reliably get around without a car.

Ask a friend/parent for a ride
**E4O1-Description**
Because people love you, they are willing to help you with your disability. It takes a huge mental toll though to reach out for help from the people you love, especially when you worry about burdening them.

Time to get on the bus! Do you have the bus driver lower the bus?

**E5O1-Name**
Yes
**E5O1-Description**
Great, now you can step on easily. It takes a lot to explain to the driver though why you need it lowered, espcially since you are not visably disabled.

Awesome! Since there are no benches nearby any bus stop for the Arlington bus at Tufts, you would have had to stand. Dodged a bullet there!

They say yes and wait, which is nice and means you won't be swept off your feet as the bus starts. But it's another things you have to ask for and explain.

Ask for a seat

Good job, you got one! It's super stressful though to go up to a stranger and ask for a seat when you are not visably disabled. At least you avoided the pain though.
